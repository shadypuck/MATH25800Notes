\section{Prime Factorizations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{1/30:}Midterm next Monday.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There's a list of topics on Canvas.
        \item Don't worry about quadratic fields (or any of the other examples in Chapter 7 of \textcite{bib:DummitFoote}). These are interesting, but will be saved for the absolute end of the course.
        \item After the midterm, Nori will start on modules.
        \item We've been talking about fields, which are contained in EDs, which are contained in PIDs. There probably will not be anything on EDs. Use the weakest definition for ED (the ones in class and the book differ). Which is this??
        \item PIDs are contained in UFDs, which are contained in integral domains, which are contained in commutative rings.
    \end{itemize}
    \item PIDs are nice! $\gcd(a,b)$ can be computed without factoring $a,b$. Review page 2 of Chapter 8, as referenced in a previous class.
    \item In PIDs, you can factor $a=qb+r$, but $q,r$ may not be specific; in EDs, these $q,r$ are unique.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Is this correct??
    \end{itemize}
    \item Theorem: $R$ is a UFD implies $R[X]$ is a UFD.
    \item Corollary: $R$ is a UFD implies $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ is a UFD.
    \begin{proof}
        Use induction.
    \end{proof}
    \item Corollary: $R[X]$ is a field implies $R$ is a PID implies $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ is a UFD.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Something about $\Z$, $F[[X]]$ where $F$ is a field??
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example: What are the irreducibles of $\Z[X]$?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prime numbers.
        \item Let $g\in\Q[X]$. Assume $g$ is monic. Then $g(X)=X^d+a_1X^{d-1}+\cdots+a_d$ for all $a_i\in\Q$. There exists $n\in\N$ such that $ng(X)\in\Z[X]$. Let $n$ be the least natural number for which this is true. It follows by our hypothesis that $n$ is the smallest such $n$ that the coefficients of $ng$ are relatively prime. Conclusion: $ng(X)$ is irreducible in $\Z[X]$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Takeaway: There are two types of irreducibles (those from $\Z$ and the new ones).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This statement has a clear parallel for every UFD.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Let $R$ be a UFD, and let $\mathcal{P}(R)\subset R\setminus\{0\}$ be such that\dots
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item Every $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(R)$ is irreducible.
        \item For all $\alpha\in\R\setminus\{0\}$, $\alpha$ irreducible, there exists a unique $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(R)$ such that $(\alpha)=(\pi)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Statement (*): Every nonzero element $\alpha\in R$ is uniquely expressible as
    \begin{equation*}
        \alpha = u\prod_{\pi\in\mathcal{P}(R)}\pi^{k(\pi)}
    \end{equation*}
    where $u\in R^\times$ and for all $\pi$, $k(\pi)\in\Zg$ and $|\{\pi\in\mathcal{P}(R)\mid k(\pi)>0\}|$ is finite.
    \begin{proof}
        $R$ is a UFD implies (*).
    \end{proof}
    \item Conversely, if $\mathcal{P}(R)$ is a subset of an integral domain $R$ such that (*) holds, then $R$ is a UFD.
    \begin{proof}
        Note that $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(R)$ implies $\pi$ is irreducible.\par
        Argument for something?? Let $\pi=ab$. Suppose $a=\pi^{m_0}\pi^{m_1}\cdots\pi_h^{m_h}u$ and $b=\pi^{n_0}\pi_1^{n_1}\cdots\pi_h^{n_h}$. Then $\pi=ab=\pi^{m_0+n_0}\pi^{m_1+n_1}\cdots$. But then because of unique factorization, we cannot have $\pi_1^{x_1}\cdots\pi_h^{x_h}$.
    \end{proof}
    \item \textbf{Content} (of $f\in R[X]$): The greatest common divisor of the coefficients of a nonzero $f=a_0+a_1X+a_2X^2\cdots$ in $R[X]$. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{c(f)}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        c(f) = \gcd(a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots)
    \end{equation*}
    \item Let $c(f)=\prod_{\pi\in\mathcal{P}(R)}\pi^{k(\pi)}$.
    \item Gauss lemma: $f,g\in R[X]$ both nonzero implies that $c(fg)=c(f)c(g)$.
    \begin{proof}
        It suffices to prove the case where $c(f)=c(g)=1$.\par
        Let $\pi$ be irreducible (hence prime). Consider the canonical surjection $R\to R/(\pi)$. It gives rise to a ring homomorphism $\varphi:R[X]\to R/(\pi)[X]$ defined by
        \begin{equation*}
            \varphi(a_0+a_1X+\cdots+a_dX^d) = \bar{a}_0+\bar{a}_1X+\cdots+\bar{a}_dX^d
        \end{equation*}
        Notationally, if $a_i\in R$, then $\bar{a}_i$ is the image of $a_i$ in $R/(\pi)$ under the canonical surjection.\par
        $c(f)=1$ implies that there exists $i$ such that $a_i\neq 0$. Therefore, $\varphi(f)\neq 0$. Similarly, $c(g)=1$ implies that $\varphi(g)\neq 0$. It follows that $\varphi(fg)=\varphi(f)\varphi(g)$. Since $R/(\pi)$ is an integral domain and thus contains no zero divisors, we know that $\varphi(fg)=\varphi(f)\varphi(g)\neq 0$. It follows that $\pi\nmid c(fg)$. This is true for all irreducible $\pi\in R$. Indeed, it follows that $c(fg)=1$.
    \end{proof}
    \item This proof can be done by brute force without quotient rings, and elegantly with quotient rings. \textcite{bib:DummitFoote} does both and we should check this out. The above is Nori's cover of just the latter, elegant argument.
    \item Let $K$ be the fraction field of $R$. We know that $K[X]$ is a PID (hence a UFD, etc.). The primes are the irreducible monic polynomials. Let $g=a_0+a_1X+\cdots+a_{d-1}X^{d-1}+X^d\in K[X]$ be monic. Then there exists a nonzero $\alpha\in R$ such that $R[X]\subset K[X]$. It follows that $a_i=\alpha_i/\beta_i$ for some $\alpha_i,\beta_i\in R$ with $\beta_i\neq 0$ since $K=\Frac R$.
    \item Claim 1: There exists a unique $\beta\in R$, $\beta=\prod_{\pi\in\mathcal{P}(R)}\pi^{k(\pi)}$, such that $\beta g\in R[X]$ and $c(\beta g)=1$.
    \begin{proof}
        Denote $\beta g$ by $\tilde{g}$. Then the claim is that $\tilde{g}\in R[X]$ has content 1. Thus,
        \begin{equation*}
            \frac{\tilde{g}}{\ell(\tilde{g})} = g
        \end{equation*}
    \end{proof}
    \item Claim 2: $g\mapsto\tilde{g}$ is a monic polynomial in $K[X]$. Then $\tilde{g}\in R[X]$ with content 1 and
    \begin{equation*}
        \widetilde{gh} = \tilde{g}\cdot\tilde{h}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        Use the Gauss lemma.
    \end{proof}
    \item Statement (*) holds as a result.
    \item $\mathcal{P}(R[X])=\mathcal{P}(R)\sqcup\{\tilde{g}\mid g\in K[X]\text{ is monic and irreducible}\}$.
    \item Claim 3: (*) holds for $\mathcal{P}(R[X])$.
    \begin{proof}
        Scratch: Let $f\in R[X]$ be nonzero. Then $f/\ell(f)\in K[X]$ for each $g_i$ monic and irreducible.\par
        $\widetilde{\frac{f}{\ell(f)}}=\tilde{g}_1^{k_1}\cdots\tilde{g}_r^{k_r}$. We have $f,\tilde{g}_1^{k_1}\cdots\tilde{g}_r^{k_r}\in R[X]$. $f=\beta(\tilde{g}_1^{k_1}\cdots\tilde{g}_r^{k_r})$. $\beta\in R$.
    \end{proof}
    \item Two remaining lectures on rings: Factoring polynomials in $\Z[X]$ and $\R[X]$.
